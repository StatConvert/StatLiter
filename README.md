# StatLiter
StatLiter is a research-oriented tool developed as part of an undergraduate thesis in Civil Engineering at the Federal University of Cariri (Universidade Federal do Cariri). The project explores the intersection of data science and artificial intelligence, focusing on text mining, statistical visualization, and scientific literature analysis.

📌 Project Context
Scientific and academic research generates massive volumes of data every year. For researchers in Civil Engineering and related fields, keeping track of relevant publications can be challenging. StatLiter aims to simplify this process by:

Automating the search and retrieval of scientific articles.
Applying text mining techniques to identify patterns and trends.
Generating statistical and graphical visualizations that support data-driven insights.
This project contributes to both the academic field of Civil Engineering and the broader discussion on how AI can transform research methodologies.

🛠️ Features
Automated literature mining from scientific corpora.
TF-IDF and other NLP-based techniques for term relevance analysis.
Data visualization tools (charts, graphs, and metrics) for clear statistical interpretation.
Scalable design for potential integration with future academic tools.

🔍 Research Objectives
To evaluate how artificial intelligence can optimize the process of analyzing scientific texts.
To explore the role of text mining in academic literature review.
To develop visual tools that make data interpretation more intuitive for scientists and engineers.

📖 Academic Origin
This repository is part of the final undergraduate thesis (TCC) in Civil Engineering at the Federal University of Cariri (Universidade Federal do Cariri).
The project reflects the growing synergy between engineering, data science, and AI research in Brazil.

📊 Tech Stack
Python (data analysis & text mining)
NLTK / SpaCy (natural language processing)
Scikit-learn (machine learning models)
Matplotlib / Plotly (statistical visualizations)
